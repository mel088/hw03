# Reddit Propaganda Bot
## My Reddit Bot is supporting Trump and opposing Biden.
I am apolitical so I wrote satirical comments.

This is my favorite thread because the comments are funny to me. One comment is mocking Trump calling him "Orange Man" while the other is pretty violent! My comment just says you should vote for trump because he has a big asset.
